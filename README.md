# thimage

Flutter game.

Each player creates his/her image with his/her prompt while keeping it hidden from the other players.
Once all images are created (1 image per player), the players vote for the one they prefer or try to retrieve who has created which image.

This flutter app uses stable diffusion to generate the images.
